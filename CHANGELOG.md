### 22.9.2
 - added subcommands `display_current`, `change_current`, `list` to pump calibration
 - Pump calibration follows the same format as LED calibrations. Current calibrations can be replaced with previous.
 - Adding calibration curves to calibrations' `display_current`
 - `pio run export_experiment_data` now has an flag argument to partition csvs by unit.
 - pump calibrations are now keyed by `media`, `waste`, `alt_media` in storage `current_pump_calibrations`

 - Bump plotext.


### 22.9.1
 - `local_ac_hz` is now optional
 - maybe fix bugs for local AP
 - add retries for button detection


###  22.9.0
 - Stirring now has the ability to restart itself if it detects it has stalled.
 - od_normalization has been removed. Instead, there is a small routine `od_statistics` that is called by both `od_blank` and `growth_rate_calculating`. The latter also now stores the required od statistics to storage (previous it was the `od_normalization` job).
 - The LEDs in the pioreactor have been moved up 0.5mm.
 - Error-handling and user improvements to `pump_calibration`.
 - `pid_turbidostat` was removed, replaced with the simpler `turbidostat`.
 - Adding new table `pioreactor_unit_activity_data` that makes analysis much easier.
 - Adding new table `calibrations`.
 - New action `od_calibration` that easily allows you to add an OD600 calibration to your pioreactor. See docs: https://docs.pioreactor.com/user-guide/calibrate-od600
 - _paramiko_ library is no longer a dependency
 - in `growth_rate_calculating` job, `kalman_filter_outputs` is now included in `published_settings`

 - `od_readings_raw` db table renamed to `od_readings`
 - `od_readings_raw.od_reading_v` renamed to `od_readings`
 - Changes to `structs.ODReadings` and `structs.ODReading`
 - Changes to where job `od_reading` publishes data in MQTT: now `.../od_reading/ods/` and `.../od_reading/od/<channel>`
 - Rename `latest_od` property in all automations to `latest_normalized_od`. Later we will introduce `latest_od` which refers to data directly from od_reading job.
 - `turbidostat` automation now accepts `target_normalized_od` instead of `target_od`. Likewise for `pid_morbidostat`.
 - new config option under `od_config`: `use_calibration` is a boolean to ask the od_reading job to use the current calibration or not.
 - `PIDTurbidostat` automation has been nuked completely.
 - New base background job, `BackgroundJobWithDodging`, that makes it easy to change an action during od reading

### 22.7.0
 - Subtle changes to how jobs disconnect and clean up. `job.set_state("disconnected")` won't clean up connections to loggers, MQTT, etc, but will signal to the app that it's no longer available to use.
 - In `config.ini`, `ir_intensity` -> `ir_led_intensity`
 - caches that keep state (like `led_locks`) now use absence and presence to determine state, instead of specific value in the cache.
 - `network.inventory` -> `cluster.inventory`
 - `network.topology` -> `cluster.topology`
 - sql table `experiments.timestamp` ->  `experiments.created_at`
 - sql table `pioreactor_unit_labels` has new column `created_at`
 - Added `TMPDIR` the env variables, which points to `/tmp/`
 - Aided development on Windows machines
 - Added new LED automation: `light_dark_cycle`. This allows for LEDs to follow a day/night cycle, at a specific LED intensity.
 - Leader now accesses other machines always using the `.local` TLD.
 - New config option `local_ac_hz`
 - New self-test routine that checks if the REF is in the correct PD channel.
 - IR REF now uses a moving average of the first few values, instead of only the initial value. This produces much more accurate normalization values.



### 22.6.0
 - You can now edit the config.ini without having to boot a Pioreactor. By adding a file called `config.ini` to the `boot` folder when the SD card is interested in a computer, the `/boot/config.ini` will be merged with the Pioreactor's `config.ini`. This is useful for changing settings before ever starting up your Pioreactor for the first time. See below.
 - `config.ini` is now the place where the local-access-point's SSID and passphrase are stored.
 - new `pio` command on leader: `pio discover-workers` returns a list of workers on the network (may be a superset of `inventory` in the config.ini)
 - new `pios` command on leader: `pios reboot`. Reboots all active workers in the cluster.
 - self-test tests run in parallel
 - Adding `NOTICE` log level, which will appear in the UI.
 - New schemas for `kalman_filter_outputs` and `od_blanks` tables in the db.

 - new leader command `pios reboot`: reboot RPis on the network, optionally specific ones with `--unit` flag.
 - new CLI tool: `pio log -m <message>` which will post a message to the pioreactors logs (everywhere). Example: this is used internally after systemd finish to log to our system.

### 22.4.2
 - Added ability to add callbacks to ODReader. See `add_pre_read_callback` and `add_post_read_callback`.
 - Fix bug associated with user changes.

 - Name change: `DosingAutomation` -> `DosingAutomationJob`, `TemperatureAutomation` -> `TemperatureAutomationJob`, `LEDAutomation` -> `LEDAutomationJob`.
 - New json-encoded datatype for changing automations over MQTT: see `pioreactor.struct.Automation`
 - `pio run led_intensity` has new API: use the flags, ex: `--A 10.0`, to set the intensities on different channels.
 - `pioreactor.actions.led_intensity` has a new API that accepts the desired state as a dict.
 - pump actions are now under `pioreactor.actions.pump` instead of their own files.

 - fix race conditions in MQTT disconnects
 - fixed a bug where a job's state would change to `lost` when another job (of the same type) would try to start.
