# Update scripts

Possible update scripts and their sequence, always run as `root`:
- `pre_update.sh` runs (if exists)
- Following this, `pip install pioreactor...whl` runs
- `update.sh` runs (if exists)
- `update.sql` to update sqlite schema runs (if exists)
- `post_update.sh` runs (if exists). Useful for restarting jobs, adding data to new db tables, or rebooting RPis.


It's very important that update scripts are idempotent. Some tips:

 - Use ChatGPT to assist psuedo-check if a script is idempotent, or making suggestions.


### `bash` specific tips
 - the scripts are run as `root` user, so `pios sync-configs` fails with auth problems. Use `sudo -u pioreactor pios sync-configs`
 - use `|| :` if a command may fail, but you want to continue anyways
 - use `trap` and `EXIT` semantics (like try / expect) to force some code block to always run.

### Checking for leader in script:

```
# Get the hostname
HOSTNAME=$(hostname)

# Get the leader hostname
# Don't use `leader_address`, as users do change that.
LEADER_HOSTNAME=$(crudini --get $PIO_DIR/config.ini cluster.topology leader_hostname)

if [ "$HOSTNAME" = "$LEADER_HOSTNAME" ]; then
  ...
fi

```


### SQL specific tips
 - use `IF EXISTS`
