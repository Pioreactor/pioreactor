    This action will create a backup of the SQLite3 database into specified output. It then
    will try to copy the backup to any available worker Pioreactors as a further backup.

    This job actually consumes _a lot_ of resources, and I've seen the LED output
    drop due to this running. See issue #81.

    To avoid database corruption, and to dodge when activities are happening, we will skip the backup if there are too many writes occurring

    Elsewhere, a cronjob is set up as well to run this action every N days.

    TODO: we should gzip before sending it, "B-tree databases like SQLite compress well so itâ€™s recommended to compress your database"
    TODO: backup more historical copies, too. Like a versioning system that logrotate does.
